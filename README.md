**Important Message: This Project is now discontinued.**
We are officially stoping development at project Codename "Kenaten". The Team simply has not got enough time for such a heavy project, and all the code was bulky and pretty dirty written. We are scraping all written code and all repos are gonna be archived. For myself, I can say that a lot of private things changed within the last few months and I currently don't want to maintain a project like this.  Eventually we are going to restart from scratch, but this try went definitely wrong.

Kenaten is our free and opensource Gods of Olympus (goo) bot. It is currently under heavy development,
and not usable at all. When it's finished, it will help your alliance by supporting other players in their battles.

## Under the hood
Kenaten connects to your Android Device via adb. It makes 
screenshots of the screen and analyze them, so it can react on some events, like a started battle.

## Device list
* [x] Sony Xepria Z3 (KaratekHD)
* [ ] Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (TTZUG)
* [ ] Oneplus 6 (KaratekHD)
