Kenaten is our free and opensource Gods of Olympus (goo) bot. It is currently under heavy development,
and not usable at all. When it's finished, it will help your alliance by supporting other players in their battles.

## Under the hood
Kenaten connects to your Android Device via adb. It makes 
screenshots of the screen and analyze them, so it can react on some events, like a started battle.

## Device list
* [x] Sony Xepria Z3 (KaratekHD)

* [ ] Oneplus 6 (KaratekHD)
