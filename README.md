# Kenaten

Kenaten was out atempt oft creating an opensource Gods of Olympus bot. Sadly, we failed.

We are officialy stoping development at project Codename "Kenaten". The Team simply has not got enough time for such a heavy project, and all the code was bulky and pretty dirty written. We are scraping all written code and all repos are gonna be archived. For myself, I can say that a lot of private things changed within the last few months and I currently don't want to maintain a project like this.  Eventually we are going to restart from scratch, but this try went definitely wrong.
